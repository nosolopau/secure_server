= Secure Server

This script allows to run a Webrick server with SSL enabled in a Rails 2.3.8 project. It's a quick and dirty script, but may help someone... :-)

= Installation

Place the script secure_server in the application's scripts folder. Run the script with the command:

  script/secure_server

Server will start and will listen to http://localhost:3433.
